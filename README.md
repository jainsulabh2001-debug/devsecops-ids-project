Hybrid DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline for Containerized Flask Application

Designed, containerized, and deployed a Flask-based web application using Docker in a hybrid infrastructure model, with a Jenkins-driven CI/CD pipeline emphasizing DevSecOps best practices. Integrated security scanning tools, including SonarQube for static code analysis and Trivy for container vulnerability scanning, along with runtime intrusion detection using Suricata. Implemented continuous monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, and enabled Slack notifications for real-time alerts and successful CI/CD pipeline stage updates.
